        DELETE REST client
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        <p>This node can be used to issue HTTP DELETE requests. DELETE requests are used to delete resources on a server.
        Usually you don't send any data with the request and you also don't get anything back, except for maybe a
        status message.</p>
        
        <p>The node allows you to either send a request to a fixed URL (which is specified in the dialog) or to a list of
        URLs provided by an optional input table. Every URL will result in one request which in turn will result in one
        row in the output table. You can define custom request headers in the dialog.</p>
        <p>By default the output table will contain a column with the received data, its content type, and the HTTP 
        status code. The node tries to automatically convert the received data into a KNIME data type based on its
        content type. In case no automatic conversion is possible, binary cells will be created.<br />
        You can extract additional response headers into column by defining them in the dialog.</p>
        <p>The node supports several authentication methods, e.g. BASIC and DIGEST. Other authentication methods may be
        provided by additional extensions.</p>

            want to request.</option>

            option is checked the node will fail if a request fails.</option>
